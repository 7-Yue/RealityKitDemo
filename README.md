# RealityKitDemo

Issue:
Currently, if i want to use RealityKit's api in ios 14 mobile device, i must set iOS deployment target to 13.0 . 
This demo currently crashes on ios14 devices.

Expectation:
Because my app still have some lower ios version users. 
I wish set xcode iOS deployment target is 10.0 and app could run success.
And, when user's device on ios13+ version, could use  RealityKit's api.

Finally, thank you for your help...
